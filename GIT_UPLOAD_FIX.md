# Git Upload Fix - Step by Step

## 🔧 **Fix the Git Issues**

### **Issue 1: Branch Name Mismatch**
You're on `master` branch but trying to push to `main`. Let's fix this:

```bash
# Check current branch
git branch

# Rename master to main
git branch -M main
```

### **Issue 2: Remote Origin URL**
The remote URL has placeholder text. Let's fix it:

```bash
# Remove the incorrect remote
git remote remove origin

# Add the correct remote (your actual GitHub repo)
git remote add origin https://github.com/biki007/univio-platform.git
```

### **Issue 3: No Commits**
The working tree is clean, meaning no changes to commit. Let's check and add files:

```bash
# Check what files are staged
git status

# If no files are staged, add them
git add .

# Check if .env.local is excluded (should show nothing)
git status | findstr ".env.local"

# Create the commit
git commit -m "feat: initial release - Univio platform v1.0.0

- Complete Next.js 15.4.5 application with TypeScript
- WebRTC video conferencing with production services
- Advanced AI features: transcription, translation, analysis
- Futuristic technologies: blockchain, quantum, neural, metaverse
- Professional UI component library with Tailwind CSS
- Complete database schema with Supabase integration
- Enterprise security with comprehensive policies
- PWA support with icon generation and manifest
- Full copyright compliance with MIT License
- Production-ready build system and deployment configuration"
```

### **Complete Fix Commands:**

```bash
# 1. Fix branch name
git branch -M main

# 2. Fix remote URL
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/biki007/univio-platform.git

# 3. Add files and commit
git add .
git commit -m "feat: initial release - Univio platform v1.0.0"

# 4. Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## 🔍 **Verification Commands**

### **Before Pushing - Security Check:**
```bash
# Verify .env.local is NOT included (should show nothing)
git ls-files | findstr ".env.local"

# Check what files will be uploaded
git ls-files | head -20
```

### **After Successful Push:**
```bash
# Verify remote connection
git remote -v

# Check branch status
git branch -a

# View commit history
git log --oneline -5
```

## 🚨 **Security Verification**

Before pushing, make sure:
- ✅ `.env.local` is NOT in the file list
- ✅ Only `.env.example` is included
- ✅ No real API keys in any files
- ✅ All sensitive data protected
